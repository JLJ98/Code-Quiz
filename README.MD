## Description

My movtivation for this project was to create a Java Script code quiz to help bootcamp students study.
This will help bootcamp students study and learn Javascript.

In this project, I successfully implemented a code quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application adheres to a set of user stories, providing a responsive and engaging experience for quiz-takers. The quiz initiates when the user clicks the "Start Quiz" button, and a timer begins counting down. Questions are presented one by one, with the ability to select answers. For incorrect responses, a penalty of ten seconds is deducted from the timer. The game concludes when all questions are answered or when the timer reaches zero. At the end, users are prompted to enter their initials, and their scores are saved in local storage. The application also features a high scores display, showcasing the top five scores. The UI is designed for clarity and user-friendly interaction, and the visual elements, such as the animated clock icon and color schemes, contribute to an enjoyable user experience. This project demonstrates proficiency in structuring and styling web applications, handling user interactions, and managing data storage.
